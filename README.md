# IMPERIAL STUDIOS - A MOCK NEXT.JS SINGLE PAGE PARALLAX SCROLLING WEBSITE (FRONTEND ONLY).

## This is a website I created to showcase some basic NextJS and TailwindCSS features.  Imperial Studios is a made-up recording studio offering 4 different levels of studio packages. <br/><br />

The site follows best practices in naming conventions, file structure and basic SEO features.  THIS IS NOT FROM ANY TUTORIAL OR 'FOLLOW - ALONG VIDEO'.  I decided to go with only the frontend design to focus on the UI, as I am primarily a frontend UI developer.  

I do have available some full stack and backend work on this github page.  Feel free to look around!
